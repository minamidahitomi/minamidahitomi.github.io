    <h3><i class="fas fa-language"></i> Japanese Linguistics </h3>
    
        <p>I am teaching Japanese linguistics courses at the University of Maryland. In Fall 2023, I am teaching <i>The Sounds and Dialects of Japanese</i>. I developed this class myself based on my research interests and potential students’ interests. What makes this class special is to cover the sound properties of non-Tokyo varieties of Japanese to promote dialect diversity in Japanese, which is often ignored in Japanese language classes and Japanese linguistics. The class materials can be found <a href="japn398d.html"><span class="text-blue">here</span></a>.</p>
    
        <p>In Spring 2024, I will be teaching <i>History of the Japanese Language</i>. This class is an overview of the Japanese language history, starting from Old Japanese in the Nara Period (8th century). In the class, I plan to cover Ryukyuan languages because it has been shown that Old Japanese and Ryukyuan languages were derived from Proto-Japonic and that some Ryukyuan languages still have features of Old Japanese. I believe that this is another type of promoting language diversity.</p>
    
    <h3><i class="fas fa-language"></i> Japanese Language</h3>
            
        <p>Teaching Japanese language is my passion. I started teaching Japanese at Syracuse University in 2014. I learned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicative_language_teaching" target="_blank"><span class="text-blue">communicative language teaching (CLT)</span></a> approach with <a href="https://thecollege.syr.edu/people/faculty/brown-amanda/" target="_blank"><span class="text-blue">Dr. Amanda Brown</span></a> there and taught Japanese as a primary instructor. At Cornell University, I taught Japanese as a teaching assistant. The Japanese language program at Cornell uses an outgrowth of what used to be called the Jordan Method, which has elements of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio-lingual_method" target="_blank"><span class="text-blue">audio-lingual</span></a> as well as communicative methods.</p>

                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></span>Minamida-sensei was absolutely the best.<font color="grey"><i>&mdash;JAPAN 2202 (Spring 2022)</i></font></li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></span>I think that her personal experiences and stories added a lot to the course. As we were learning about various topics, I thought it added a sense of reality when she says things like "oh, my friend did this," or "oh, that has an accent". It gives the sense that the class is also a class on culture, and you can immerse yourself through thee [<i>sic</i>] language.<font color="grey"><i>&mdash;JAPAN 2202 (Spring 2022)</i></font></li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></span>Minamida sensei was always very cheerful and encouraging during our lessons. I really appreciated it when she would explain things through a linguistics perspective in class as well!<font color="grey"><i>&mdash;JAPAN 2202 (Spring 2021)</i></font></li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></span>I actually like Minamida-sensei shared her research into Japanese dialect. It was too deep for me now but really interesting. A few sentences' sharing is good!<font color="grey"><i>&mdash;JAPAN 2202 (Spring 2021)</i></font></li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></span>Minamida sensei was a delight to learn from. I definitely appreciated her willingness to teach us new vocabulary words and even taking the time to spell it out in Japanese on the chat box. She was more than patient with us students and would always guide us to the right way to say things. I enjoyed our conversations during discussions and how we would always laugh at what witty comment each student had to say (even in our kindergarten level of speaking Japanese).<font color="grey"><i>&mdash;JAPAN 1101 (Fall 2020)</i></font></li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></span>Your reviews have been very helpful.<font color="grey"><i>&mdash;LING 1101 (Spring 2020)</i></font></li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></span>Minamida-sensei made the class super engaging and fun. I've really come to love learning Japanese, as every discussion we laugh and learn from our mistakes in a positive way. She's so patient and enthusiastic for every single class.<font color="grey"><i>&mdash;JAPAN 1101 (Fall 2019)</i></font></li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></span>Minamida Sensei made section very entertaining without compromising classroom integrity. She was very effective at explaining questions and leading activities. I always looked forward to the days when she was teaching.<font color="grey"><i>&mdash;JAPAN 1101 (Fall 2019)</i></font></li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></span>She is an excellent listener and leads the class well. Her attention to detail proves that she is putting a lot of effort into her teaching, and it shows because her classes are always filled with laughter and productive conversations.<font color="grey"><i>&mdash;JAPAN 2202 (Spring 2019)</i></font></li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></span>She explains everything clearly and gives everyone and [<i>sic</i>] opportunity to speak. I thoroughly enjoyed her classes and I will be sad not to be able to have a class with her again.<font color="grey"><i>&mdash;JAPAN 2202 (Spring 2019)</i></font></li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></span>Really helped in increasing my interest for the subject. Has lots of energy which got students a lot more involved in discussions. Would love to have her in my future Japanese classes.<font color="grey"><i>&mdash;JAPAN 1101 (Fall 2017)</i></font></li>
                <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i></span>I like how Minamida-sensee made discussion very casual and was very nice even when we made mistakes. She also remembered our responses and would ask us about them the week after, which I really appreciated.<font color="grey"><i>&mdash;JAPAN 1101 (Fall 2017)</i></font></li>
